Source Code Management
=======================

Version control is a way to keep a track of the changes in the code so that if something goes wrong, we can make comparisons in different code versions and revert to any previous version that we want.

## Objective:

* To understand the code changes that are performed in production should be tracked.

## Features:

* Ability to know the code changes in base org and patch org(support from 20.1)

* Ability to go back and trace the changes from any point in time from Feb 2020
